    <h1>The Most Sad/Emotionful Love Live Songs 2022</h1>
    <h2>By Daniel P</h2>
    <h3><i>If you disagree, you can't because I only speak facts.</i></h3>

    <p>TLDR: Below is a list of the most emotionalful/crying songs if you don't want to read (Number 1 being the best):</p>
    <p><i>Every released song from Love Live was taken in consideration, from group singles to soloes. </i></p>
    <p><i>My main criteria is vocal quality, instrumentation, uniqueness, and overall wow-factor/impact as a whole.</i></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Snow Halation by µ's</li>
        <li>Starlight Prologue by Liella</li>
        <li>Chase by Setsuna Yuki</li>
        <li>Matataki no Saki e by Liella</li>
        <li>Sore mo Kokoro mo Hareru kara by Aqours</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Why I'm Right About My Top 1</h1>
    <p> So Snow Halation is objectively the number one song for Love Live. It's too iconic, it's too memorable, and it's what kick started off the series so strong. The context around Snow Halation in School Idol Project was done very well in Season 2, and it makes the song more memorable. </p>
    <p>Looking past this song's iconic-ness and memorability, the song's lyrics are very beautiful and µ's singing is great as well together.</p>
    <p> Relatively speaking, µ's does not have the best singers in Love Live. The song is split up in three mini "subunits" with Honoka, Umi, and Nozomi being the leading three.</p>
    <p> The second group is Eli, Nico, and Hanayo. And the very last group is Kotori, Rin, and Maki. </p>
    <p> I'm going to be very blunt but the reason why part of this song fits well in comparison with other µ's songs is because each time each group sings, they are carried hard by a duo or someone.</p> 
    <p>Honoka and Umi carry the first, Eli carries the second, and Rin and Kotori blend well. It's overall a 10/10 romance Love Live song.</p>

    <h1>Starlight Prologue by Liella</h1>
    <p>A Liella song. Yeah I picked a Liella song. As much I like Aqours and µ's, they are probably the most talented vocalists Love Live has seen so far. </p>
    <p>This song feels like a tribute to Snow Halation, and if that's true it won't be suprising. In terms of singing, it's practically flawless with crystal-clear vocals and puntucal and senimental strings accompanied with a ballad-rock drumkit. It's a very dramatic song with lots of pauses and climaxes, and Kanon's voice is hauntingly good at some parts. </p>

    <h1>Chase by Setsuna Yuki</h1>
    <p>I'm going to say it: Setsuna Yuki is probably the best singer in Nijigasaki. Choosing the best Nijigasaki singer is a whole debate of its own, but Chase from Season 1 of Nijigasaki was a<b> bold </b>statement by Love Live. In my perspective, it was basically saying that Love Live is being renovated and it's changing. New talented singers, new genres, and soloes that are absolutely different from anything we've seen from the past. </p>
    <p>Chase is a very rock heavy song, with impressive singing by Setsuna, able to easily jump octave intervals and her belting/yelling moments throughout the song are shockingly good. It's like actual rock.</p>
    <p>In terms of technical singing ability, Setsuna wins hands down. Her voice is controlled, rich, and brimming with raw emotion and intense vibrato.</p>
    <p>If I had to nitpick, the instrumentation is not that interesting or inspired, but Setsuna's perfomance makes up for it immensely.</p>

    <h1>Matataki no Saki e by Liella</h1>
    <p>If you add a somber string section with any Liella singer and make a ballad backing track, I'll probably get sad and think it's the best song ever. Matataki no Saki e is probabaly one of the most sentimental and emotional songs ever created by Love Live. </p>
    <p>Make no mistake, there are plenty of big contenders to claiming this title: Seinaru Hi no Inori, No. 10, and even Bokutachi wa Hitotsu no Hikari.</p>
    <p>It's a tough choice, it's such a tough choice. But Matataki no Saki e is maturely harmonized and each voice is sweeping with emotion, like an outstretched hand towards something. The instrumentation is a piano and a string section, and it's simple yet elegant. Kanon doesn't carry, everyone does when they sing in unison. </p>

    <h1>Sore mo Kokoro mo Hareru kara by Aqours</h1>
    <p>It feels like the song to play after a long day. There are a lot of amazing Aqours songs but it's so difficult to chose one and be firm about it. I love Happy Party Train, Horizon, Mirari Ticket, and Kiseki Hikaru. </p>
    <p>I suppose the context of this song and how much I like Riko, Chika, and You made me choose this song. This spot in the future will change.</p>
